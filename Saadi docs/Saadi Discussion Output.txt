Control Room for Smartcity:
-open source code for command and contol
-in the smart city we have dashboard center to manage the city
-http://ccf.sourceforge.net/
-http://cctcorp.com/products/command-and-control-software/ (from me)
take the data from many systems in the smart city like transportation system, energy, water system, urban system, healthcare sytem ...the data comes from these systems will proces and manage in our control room to make real time decision. 
-It is to control many heterogenous wsn's

they are using bioharness

[12/11/2013 11:19:13 PM] Nadeem Mehmood: managing BigData with SOA Middleware i.e. Hadoop
While considering the previous discussion I am more focused towards the integration area especially in context to the communication and data integration middlewares. I have plan to write the REST Clients to retrieve data from the tele-medicine platforms for the integration purposes. Such REST Clients and other controls commends shall be the part of the data integration and analysis task of mine. I have the following reserve plans for the goals to achieve in the next two years in context to this selected area.
