An Advance Wireless Snesor Network for Health Monitoring by Verginia Univeristy
[Abstract]
-old people can take benifit from continous, remote health monitoring
-It is a proposal with little development in this field with the following characteristics
	.open new research perspectives for low cost
	.ah hoc deployment of multimodal sensors
[Introduction]
-In-home and nursing home perspective networks to provide
	.continous medical monitoring
	.memory enhancement
	.control of home appliances
	.medical data access
	.emergency communication
-researchers in this area [1-8]
	.for diseases like Alzheimer's Parkinson's (similarly continous disorder)-continous monitoring [6]
	.CodeBlue-medical appliances in disasters [7]
	.robustness and efficiency in healthcare wsns [2]
ii-[Main Goals]
-Continous monitoring for medical history[9,10]
-ad-hoc and self-manageing networeks are used to reduce the high installation costs and retrofits
-this system will extend the traditional clinical hospital setting to nursing and retirement homes
-Hardware
	.MicaZ device from Crossbow with an environmental sensor board on it
	.1.Portability and unobstrusiveness
	.2.Ease of deplyment nad scalability
	.3.Realtime and allways on
	.4.Reconfigureaable and self-organization
		..no fixed installation
		..we can add and remove sensors instantantly
		..we can change the network target
		..sensors can form their routing paths
		..sensors can collaborate on data processing
		..they can adopt further hierarcheis
iii-[Highlevel System Architecture]
-System untegrates both the wearable and in building installed sensor devices
-These devices informs the healthcare service providers about the health of the patient
-RFIT tages, floor, environmental and dust sensors
-1-Body Network and Subsystems:
	.in this system the devices may use kinetic recharges
	.
-2-Emplaced Sensor Network:-
