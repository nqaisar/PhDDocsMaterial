Summary:
-Integration of pool of computers and resources to get the power of a super computer.
-Layers, Structures, Middleware
--Grid Fabric(GF)
---Process Management Technology
---It is the middleware that entirely manages all the resources.
---Grid computing application requires more parallalism.
---User Level Grid Middleware
---Applications that facilitate the parallalism

Operation
--First Layer: Applicaiton Pool
--Grid Broker(GB):Central Character
---Grid Info Services(GIS): Have the knowledge about the available resources.
---Grid Market Dictory(GMD):Knows the cost of the resources
---Grid Data Catalog(GDC): If the app requires the data, GB access the DGC and checks which one is the nearest data resource.
---then the DB send your request to the resource
---Grid Bank: you are charged completly. You have to pay that amont of resources.
There is no standardization of Grids so far, organizaitons are working on to have standards such as CERN.
